#Install to Project Repo
A Python script for easily installing libraries to an in-project Maven repository. It creates a repository in the root folder of the project complete with poms, checksums and metadata. It also outputs the appropriate dependencies xml to be inserted in your `pom` file.

##What it does
* When run in standard mode it looks for jars in the `lib` folder having name of Eclipse standard and ignores all files that don't match it. The Eclipse naming standard has the following format: 

        groupId.artifactId[.source]_version[.SNAPSHOT].jar

* When run in interactive mode (`-i`) it asks you to choose from the possible variants of name resolution. In this mode you can parse files of different naming standards.

* When run with `-d` modifier it removes all successfully installed jars from the `lib` folder.

* After successful installation of all jars it prints out all according dependencies for your `pom`.


##Using

Just run it from the folder containing your lib folder. 

After the script is complete copy-paste the generated dependencies xml to your `pom` under `dependencies` tag and add the following under the `repositories` tag:

    <repository>
      <id>project</id>
      <url>file://${project.basedir}/repo</url>
    </repository>

* This version was updated to support apache libraries formats e.g. mysql-connector-java-5.1.22.jar.  The --help option describes in more detail.  (Updated on 1/27/2012 by Stephen Boesch javadba@gmail.com)


##Example
If the structure of the `lib` folder is as follows:

    lib/
    | - org.eclipse.e4.xwt_0.9.1.SNAPSHOT.jar
    | - org.eclipse.e4.xwt.source_0.9.1.SNAPSHOT.jar

Running the script in standard mode will result in the project's repository of the following structure having been created:
    
    repo/
    | - org/
    |   | - eclipse/
    |   |   | - e4/
    |   |   |   | - xwt/
    |   |   |   |   | - 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT/
    |   |   |   |   |   | - maven-metadata-local.xml
    |   |   |   |   |   | - maven-metadata-local.xml.md5
    |   |   |   |   |   | - maven-metadata-local.xml.sha1
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar.md5
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar.sha1
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.md5
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.sha1
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.pom
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.pom.md5
    |   |   |   |   |   | - xwt-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT.pom.sha1
    |   |   |   |   | - maven-metadata-local.xml
    |   |   |   |   | - maven-metadata-local.xml.md5
    |   |   |   |   | - maven-metadata-local.xml.sha1

It will also print out the Maven installation process log info messages followed by this Maven dependency to be inserted in your `pom`:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.e4</groupId>
      <artifactId>xwt</artifactId>
      <version>0.9.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
